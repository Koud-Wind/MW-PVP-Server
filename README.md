# MW-PVP-Server
Added two new games, optimized some commands, and allowed the store to use some new weapons, The English translation may be poor, but the server requires two players to start the game

Perhaps there is more, I may not remember clearly

There are also some activities related to April Fool's Day (which require modifying the name of the MC function and additional plugins)

0.7.26 is a version that has been modified by me and Tang7. Some class classes do not have source code, so I used the old version of class classes

In addition, version 0.7.26 does not need to be distributed, just use the latest vmw.
