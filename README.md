# MW-PVP-Server
The invited collaborators here have the right to deploy it to their own server species


Mini game server with 6 PVP gameplay and 1 PVE gameplay

It can be used as a sub server, but in terms of currency, vanilla scoreboards are used

Why is there so little introduction here? My brain is completely blank XD
